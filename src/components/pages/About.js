        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Austin, Texas. In my spare time I enjoy reading new books, watching movies or playing games with my friends. 
          I also do my best at knitting (strictly rectangular objects). I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Texas State University. 
          The work included here is a result of my work in the UT Austin Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.</p>
